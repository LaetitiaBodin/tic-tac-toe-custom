## HOW TO PLAY ##
This is a two-player game.  
Each given turn, the player chooses a square to draw their sign in.  
As soon as a player manages to get all the squares in a row (vertical, horizontal or diagonal), they win the game.  
If all the squares have been played but neither player gets a full row, the game ends with a tie.  

## GAME SETUP ##
The players may chose from a 3 x 3 grid to a 10 x 10 grid.  
Once the choice is made, they can start playing.  
Player 1 will play with 'X' and Player 2 will play with 'O'.
